=========================
5. Troubleshooting
=========================

- Ensure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements.  Installing L.A. Street Racing on a computer that does not meet the minimum system requirements can lead to unpredictable results.

- Before installing the game, make sure all running programs, especially anti-virus software, are closed.  Many installation problems are avoided this way.

- If you are still experiencing problems installing L.A. Street Racing, please follow these steps:

1. With CD 1 inserted, double click MY COMPUTER.

2. Right-click the CD\DVD drive and select EXPLORE.

3. Go to the EDIT menu and select SELECT ALL.

4. Go to the EDIT menu once more and select COPY.

5. Find a place on your hard drive to copy these files. We suggest just copying them to a folder on your desktop. To do this, right click your desktop and select NEW, then FOLDER.  Open the New Folder that appears, right-click inside the folder and select PASTE.

6. The files will now copy from the CD 1 to your hard drive. This will take a few minutes.

7. Once the game has copied, double click RunSetup.exe from where you copied the files to install the game.

This process should take the CD\DVD drive out of the installation procedure, so that any problems with the disc itself are avoided.

- If you are running Windows XP or Windows 2000 you must install L.A. Street Racing via a user account with Administrator or Power User privileges. If you do not have administrator or power user privileges, please contact your system administrator for further details.

- If you are running a firewall or a router, you may experience difficulties attempting to play L.A. Street Racing on a LAN or the Internet.  You must configure your firewall\router to allow L.A. Street Racing to access ports 443, 12321, 12346 for the master matchmaking server.

- Ensure that TCP and UDP are enabled for all of these ports. If you do not know how to do this, contact your system administrator or firewall\router vendor for further information.

- If your machine is running Windows XP with Service Pack 1 (SP1) installed and Internet Connection Firewall enabled, you may experience difficulties attempting to play L.A. Street Racing on a LAN or the Internet. To correct this, you should either install Service Pack 2 (SP2) or disable the Internet Connection Firewall from your network settings. Follow these steps to disable the Internet Connection Firewall:

1. Click the Start Menu.

2. Select Control Panel or if you are running Windows in classic mode select Settings.

3. Select Internet and Network connections and then Network Connections.  Or if you are running windows in classic mode select network connections.

4. Right click on your Local Area Connection icon and select Properties.

5. Click on the “Advanced” tab.

6. Make sure there is no checkmark in the box next to “Protect my computer and network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet”.

- If you are running Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2), you may experience issues attempting to play L.A. Street Racing over the Internet due to the SP2 firewall. To correct this, follow these steps:

1. Launch L.A. Street Racing.

2. From the main menu, click Multiplayer Settings.

3. When the server browser comes up, press ALT and TAB at the same time. This will return you to your Windows desktop.

4. A window entitled “Windows Security Alert” should be present.  Click Unblock to allow L.A. Street Racing to access Internet game servers.

5. Click L.A. Street Racing in the Windows taskbar. This will return you to the game.

6. Quit L.A. Street Racing by selecting Exit Game from the main menu.

7. Re-launch L.A. Street Racing - you should now be able to connect to Internet games.

- Some video cards, often included with laptops, have a rotation feature that can cause the game to display sideways. Going into your display properties and disabling the rotation feature should solve this issue. Contact your video card manufacturer for further support regarding the rotation feature.

- DirectX 9.0c is included on the L.A. Street Racing CD 1, but you may also need to obtain the latest DirectX 9.0 compliant drivers from your hardware manufacturer’s website. Many technical problems can be resolved by simply updating your video and sound card drivers.

- Depending on your system configuration, game play performance may be altered by changing graphical options in the Settings, Video Settings menu. Lowering the Resolution and Video Mode will allow the game to run faster, while increasing them may cause the game to run slower but look better. If game play performance is still poor, you can also turn down the Detail Level and Shadows on this screen. Remember to click Apply Video Changes after making changes to these options. Adjusting one (or all) of these graphical options can dramatically increase game play
speed.

- For optimal game play performance we recommend closing all other programs or applications before playing L.A. Street Racing.
